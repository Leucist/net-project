[{"Header":"Neural Networks","Text":"Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. In this chapter, we will explore the basics of neural networks, including their architecture, learning algorithms, and applications. We\u0027ll discuss the building blocks of neural networks, such as neurons and layers, and how they are interconnected to process and analyze data. Additionally, we\u0027ll delve into popular neural network architectures like feedforward, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks, and their use cases in various domains such as image recognition, natural language processing, and robotics.","Type":"Article"}]
